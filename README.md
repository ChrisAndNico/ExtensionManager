# About the Dev-Team
Firstly, a little bit about the dev team.  My Name is Nico and I am the designer of the PoE Extension Manager. Beside me is Chris, who is the programmer and scripter. We are two German guys in our mid 30´s and we love gaming. We have kids, family and have been best friends for a number of years. Design and Coding are not our jobs in real life, so we don't expect everything to be perfect from the beginning, but we are working hard in our free-time to improve and upgrade this tool. We created this tool, as we were annoyed at the amount of time wasted on setting up extensions and add-ons, and thought, let's fix it. We started off small, creating simple batch scripts to make our life easier, and now it has turned into the extension manager tool, which we are extremely proud of, and that we are now looking forward to sharing with the community. Making this great game, even better.

# What the PoE Extension Manager can offer you: 
Easy – let's go through the normal way of starting PoE after a long hard day of work/or school. 

Step 1: FCK Yeah, let's play some PoE today. 

Step 2: Wait, I need a shit load of Extension's to really make my gameplay perfect.  

Step 3: So, let's go to the folder where I have all my nice Extensions installed.

Step 4: Start the first Extension, for example, Path of Building, so you know how to set up your Character.

Step 5: Start the second Extension, for example, TradeMacro, to check in-game currency and prices.

Step 6: Start the third Extension, for example, MercuryTrade for better in-game trading.

Step 7: Start other tools like chat helper, or your Browser to search for the Build or video guides. 

Phew! that takes a lot of time, right? So here we come! To the rescue PoE-Extension Manager! We handle all those add-ons and extensions in only one small tool.

# How PoE Extension Manager work's: 
Start the PoE-Extension Manager and import all the Extensions. For this please use the magnifier icon beside the check boxes. Also, we will add an auto search function in the future (read more under „Roadmap “). After this, your implemented Extension will be activated directly. Check or uncheck the Extension you want to load up together with Path of Exile. Also note, that the game directory of PoE is selected and activated.

-When you set up everything just hit the Power Button and all Tools including PoE will start automatically.-
-You may need to install the .NET framework for this tool to work, press the setup.exe to install this beforehand.-

Another neat feature is when you close PoE down, you can simply press the power button, and all your add-ons and extensions will close automatically - saving time.
